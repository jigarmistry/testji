I went through the paper "Symbolic summation with radical expression" 
and I found myself unable to understand many points due to my 
insufficient mathematical background which is summarized below: 

1. Calculus(Single and Multivariable) 
2. Coordinate Geometry 
3. Sequences Series (General properties of series) 
4. Complex numbers 
5. Basic Linear Algebra 
6. Binomial Theorem, Permutation and Combination 

I haven't done any abstract algebra. 
However, I went through the idea list and found the idea "SYMBOLIC 
COMPUTATION OF INTEGRALS BY RECURRENCE" interesting. I went through 
Michael Barnett's paper and it seemed approachable to me with my 
mathematical background. Also I saw that integration is currently done 
using Risch-Norman Algorithm, and it needs to be improved. 


Is the implementation of this algorithm appropriate as a Summer of 
code project?  Is my mathematical background enough for the successful 
execution of this project?
